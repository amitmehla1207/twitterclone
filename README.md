**Welcome to my twitter clone.**

_**(Version 1.0)**_**[\- View on Github](https://github.com/amitmehla1207/twitterclone)**

_**I am regularly updating it to match exactly all features of twitter.**_

This application is built using ReactJs, React-redux and Redux, Context API.

This Clone is optimised for a desktop only (min view-port size must be > 750px)

Some of the features includes:

*   Automatically fixed right-side bar.
*   Twitter style pop-ups.
*   Twitter style Drop downs.
*   Fetching posts using redux.

My biggest dream is to become a good web developer. I hope one day I will achieve it.Â 

**Disclaimer:** Expecting the color codes, no other HTML or CSS code has been copied from original Twitter Website. Hence I declare that the work is solely mine.
